Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Installing Ansible and Setting Up SSH Connectivity on Ubuntu
1. Update System Packages
Open a terminal or SSH into your master node.
Run the following command to update the package index:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
2. Install Ansible
Install Ansible by running:

sudo apt install ansible -y
Verify the installation by checking the Ansible version:

ansible --version
Ensure the version matches the latest stable release. If required, refer to Ansible's official documentation for the latest release details.
3. Set Up SSH Connectivity
a. Navigate to the .ssh Directory
Move to the SSH directory:

cd ~/.ssh/
b. Create and Configure a Private Key File
Create a new file named ansible-key:

nano ansible-key
Paste your private key into the file. For example, if using an AWS .pem file, copy the entire contents of your .pem file and paste them here.
Save and exit the file (e.g., in nano, press Ctrl + O, then Enter to save, and Ctrl + X to exit).
c. Secure the Private Key
Restrict access to the private key file:

chmod 600 ansible-key
d. Verify the Key
Check that the key has been correctly saved:

cat ansible-key
This will display the key contents.
e. Add the Key to the SSH Agent
Start the SSH agent:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add the private key:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/ansible-key
4. Test SSH Connectivity
Verify that you can connect to a child node (replace <child-node-ip> with the appropriate IP address):

ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible-key ubuntu@<child-node-ip>
Ensure there are no errors and you can log in.
5. Add Child Nodes to Ansible Inventory
Edit the Ansible inventory file (default location: /etc/ansible/hosts):

sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
Add your child nodes under a specific group, for example:

[webservers]
192.168.1.101 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/ansible-key
192.168.1.102 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/ansible-key
Save and exit the file.
6. Test Ansible Connectivity
Run the following command to test connectivity:

ansible -m ping all
This should return SUCCESS for all nodes in the inventory.
Additional Notes
Python Installation (if required):

sudo apt install python3 -y
For Amazon Linux systems:

sudo yum install python3 -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable ansible2
sudo yum install ansible -y
ansible --version
